# End of my Competitive osu!mania Career

Today, `3rd September 2022`, is marked as my last day of playing osu!mania competitively. I've said a long time ago that I will quit after MWC2022 and the day has come. It was a really long journey but every journey has their ends. 

## Reasons why I quit

Firstly, lately I feel really forced into playing a game for competitive purpose. I needed to derust for this and this event only but I didn't feel like it at all. It was all for the Thailand Team this year, but I don't have enough time and motivation for them.

Next, there are many more important things for me to focus on. I feel like I am more into developing, staffing and mapping. Mania Staff Community feels really welcoming to me and I've had so much fun working within these fields. So I would rather working on these than being in a competitive field.

I also need to focus on my academic stuff as my university courses are getting more difficult, theoretical and more interesting. I started to see myself not understanding some certain topics so I need to reactivate myself again.

## My future

My osu! future is as what I stated earlier. I will do more jobs regarding mappools, mostly on custom maps, and will do composing as a side job. But I will do more side projects regarding Data Analysis and Web Development too (there are big ones coming up, stay tuned). In the far future, I want to push the applied mathematics, statistics field forward (actually Data Science stuff). I want to write more research to contribute to the field. As my life developed like this, it is worth a try going for a high level degree in these fields.

Besides that, I also want to create my own business, I currently put that as a side job right now but I do have some ideas in mind.

## Tribute

osu! is beyond a game to me. It is where I learn, I try, I fail, I accomplish, whatever that is. There are some significant people I've met in my life, in tournament organization field, or even in academic field. People here are so kind and helpful to me. Literally this community changed my life in a good way. This community got me to know myself what am I passionate for.

As I mentioned, it was a bare coincidence to meet an irl person in osu!, named **Ph0eNiiXZ**. He is my closest friend during the university. Well I actually got a last playing motivation burst for 2021 and 2022 because of him (at first I was thinking about hiding my osu! identity there but this thing happens so whatever) and... 

There is an online person who affects my life in many ways, getting me more motivated studying in the field I would say, and contributed to my projects as an interpreter or something. I will not give a name but you know who you are.

**Surfchu85**, you are my idol, I'm sorry I might annoy you a bit but you are my inspiration in statistics, whether it is about modelling and more detailed stuff. If not because of you I might just stuck with my Stat 1 and 2 knowledge.

**Mikuaimbot**, thank you for your help for MWC2022 Thailand Team Organization. Just thank you for covering me up when I was busy and thank you for motivating me to play in this tournament... Thank you for creating the historical part of my life...

**banan**, thank you for the space to rant and thank you for trusting me. Thank you for practicing MWC for us even not in a good health condition. Thank you for your time playing MWC with us.

**konkawe**, thank you for building confidence for us, Thailand Team. Your words mean a lot to us and continue doing it. I hope I see you go far whether in osu! or real life.

**Silhoueska Elze**, thank you for commentating our matches and be such a good friends. Thank you for listening to me when I am mentally broken. I appreciate you a lot.

**MWC2022 Thailand Team**, thank you for the journey, it was a long ride isn't it. I can't believe the performance we did, the time we disappointed, the time we relieved, the time we laughed, the time we smiled. Just let you know that you are one of the osu!mania Thailand History. You did your best and... thank you very much.

**All Opponents I've met**, whether in major tournaments, mini tournaments or MWC, Good Game Well Played. You all are the one that motivated me to play, maybe the tournament accomplishment is just friends we made along the way.

**Mahidol University osu! Players**, yall are just amazing. I didn't think I will build and grow this community but like... It actually happened somehow. If I don't know you guys this wouldn't even happen so yeah thank you so much.

**osu!mania Staff Team**, whether you are in **Thailand Tournament Organization** or whatever international tournaments those are. Thank you for the opportunity, I swear I got from having no clue what to do to getting to play a significant role in tournament organization here. It was a wild ride and I will continue doing it.

## Congratulations, you found my secret message.

*"HowToPlayLN is my idol now"*, this phrase was said by someone after I was eliminated from SOFT5. It is still stick in my head til these days. I can't believe I was an inspiration for someone in game and in real life. I will try my best to be an inspiration for newer osu! people.

## Important 

I will take a break until **7th September 2022** after today for personal reasons and for the good of a community. If you think you are the one I trust you can ask me what is happening.
