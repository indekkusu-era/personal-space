# LNCryption & o!mLN3 Afterthoughts

Yesterday, `28th November 2022`, was the day I released the custom track for osu!mania LN Tournament 3, **LNCryption**. The fact is, I was really proud of this work that it is my best work up to date.

## LNCryption?

**LNCryption** is a story that is associated to the very **osu!mania LN Tournament 3** custom maps, it was idealized by me, HowToPlayLN. My approach to this was to write my own reflection in the way that it is related with the beatmaps, or the more cryptic way, where the character encountered the various struggles. The full story is located in [my own website](https://indekkusu-era.github.io/lncryption/) with 11 custom maps participated the main story, and 4 custom maps participated the [additional story](https://indekkusu-era.github.io/lncryption/ex/1.txt). After that, there are 3 more storylines from other 3 custom mappers, Logan636, FelixSpade and Polytetral. Which is connected within this so-called LNCryption.

I decided to create an original osu!mania LN Tournament 3 track just to represent the story of (my) LNCryption, the track represented how chaotic and unpleasant the place was and how the character of each story suffered from it. The emotion of anger and jealousy, and the mental suffocation were presented in the track within the dissonances and the unconventional time signatures. So the song sounded like a creepypasta and gave the uncomfortable feelings to the listeners.

### LNCryption full story (my own interpretation)

LNCryption, in my own interpretation was the character in the story suffered from the motivation loss and tried to reach their target. As how the world progressed, it was near impossible for everything to make sense within the short span of time. Until they looked back to their own past mistakes and failures, they thought it was not too late to go back and fix their own mistakes again and as they found their own reflection in the mirror. It reminded that they needed to stay on track and keep looking towards their goal (the horizon). However, those consequences of past mistakes were haunting them down, which is the incident no one can avoid after all. It went through like the shattered glass which destroyed their ability to feel.

The character looked back at themselves and found the freedom of being emotionless, that they could get out of their boundaries in their mind, however it was the time again that they needed to live a normal life in a different state.

## o!mLN3 Afterthoughts

At last, it was the end of my work in osu!mania LN Tournament 3. With not less than 14 custom maps/collabs, 1 composition, 1 collab storyboard various testplays and replays. I am surely happy that everyone, including me enjoyed my work on this tournament. I was truly speechless when the Grand Finals mappool showcase was finished. It was truly a lot of effort the host and the staff team who involved in this tournament pulled out.

To be honest, this contribution was for the entire community and myself, which means I was really enjoying this work as the staff team are encouraging each other to create the tremendous amount of contribution into this tournament.

For me, myself, I would not take all the credits from this, it was all the mappool selection and the organization team who deserved all of it. Absolutely infinite appreciation to the mappers who pulled out those fascinating work, and the hosts for making these all happen. It was really wonderful working with you all.

To be honest, the 3 original compositions from this tournament were out of our expectations a lot, with how creative the uses of the song structures, the time signatures and the production quality... I could see that the composers, **takehirotei** and **Supa7onyz (aka. Normalizer)** were putting a lot of effort into the compositions.

These epic compositions wouldn't be what they are without the background artworks, countless thanks into the artists for the artwork and graphics for this tournament. The artists were doing an unimaginable work for a humankind. Appreciate you all a lot.

Lastly, thank you Polytetral for supporting us in the mappool selection scene all the time. I am pretty sure that the last week was really tough for you as you were approaching the finals week, and you needed to do all the graphics for the fascinating Grand Finals Mappool Showcase. I appreciated you so much from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much for giving us opportunities, and making these all happen.

Well, as much as my memories went, I couldn't include all of people who involved in this, but... you know who you are and I love you all. Continue doing what you are passionate with and I hope to see you all, and this community success. Thank you for joining this journey with us.

As always, thank you for visually listening to me again, I hope you all have a wonderful day. Stay safe and motivated.

Love and Respect,
